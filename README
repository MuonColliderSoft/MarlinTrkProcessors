 | v01-02 |
  -------- 

SiliconTracking_MarlinTrk &	First version which is able to reconstruct LOI data.
 FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk:

 SimpleCylinderDigiProcessor:	New - Uses simple gaussian smearing for cylinders.

 TruthTracker:			Fixed bug in SimTrackerHitSortPredicate.

 SimpleDiscDigiProcessor:	For LOI data the z coordinate is now set to that of the disk and the tolerance for dz has been increased to 10 microns.

 | v01-01 |
  -------- 

 SiliconTracking_MarlinTrk &   Modified to use getHitsInFit from MarlinTrk to get the correct TrackState for the first and last hits. 
 FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk:    SiliconTracking has had the work around applied for the optimization problem of compare_r as applied 
                               to FullLDCTracking.

  SimplePlanarDigiProcessor:  
  			      Creates TrackerHits from SimTrackerHits, smearing them according to the input parameters. 
 			      The plannar geometry should be either VXD, SIT or SET described using ZPlannarLayout
 			      The positions of "digitized" TrackerHits are obtained by gaussian smearing positions
 			      of SimTrackerHits perpendicular and along the ladder according to the specified point resolutions.

  SimpleDiscDigiProcessor: 
  			      Produces a TrackerHit collection from SimTrackerHit collection. Intended for use with the FTD.
			      The positions of "digitized" TrackerHits are obtained by gaussian smearing positions
			      of SimTrackerHits in (x,y) plane according to the specified point resolution. 
	
  SiliconTracking_MarlinTrk:  Processor performing stand-alone pattern recognition in the VTX, FTD and SIT.
  			      Adaption of the of the original SiliconTracking from A. Raspereza, to use MarlinTrk.

  FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk:  Processor performing track finding procedure in the entire ILD detector by linking track segments found 
                              by the SiliconTracking module in the silicon detectors and by Clupatra in the TPC. 
			      Adaption of the of the original SiliconTracking from A. Raspereza, to use MarlinTrk.

  RefitProcessor:             Track Refitter processor for marlin. Refits an input track collection using MarlinTrk, 
                              producing a new collection of tracks. Primarily to demonstrate the use of MarlinTrk.

  TruthTracker:     	      Track creation based on MC truth. Uses Relations between TrackerHits and SimTrackerHits to produce a track 
  			      collection. It can also fit the tracks using MarlinTrk or fill the track collection with the helix parameters
                              of the MCParticle.
